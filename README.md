# Scuffed-Stacker-69
Not the definitive block stacker game, but it sure is one of them.

This is the source code to my first project made with unity

The code is very spaghettified and difficult to work with, but was a good learning experience
Things visibly got cleaner and cleaner as I moved through the workflow and learned new things

Things I would like to improve upon or implement in future projects:
    -Use C# or Unity events to separate logic from visuals
    -Place brackets in a uniform way throughout all code (Likely giving brackets their own line)
    -Write descriptive code comments frequently and in an organized fashion
    -Modularize code - reduce the amount of variables declared, make code plug in more easily and make it expandable

That is all
